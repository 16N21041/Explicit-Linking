# Explicit Linking

Here I have created four .dll files and linked them with our main module. The type of linking here is explicit linking, i.e., linking at the time of running of a program. This saves memory as the files are called when they are needed at the time of running of the program. Debugging of the program is also easy as there are different modules of each task.
